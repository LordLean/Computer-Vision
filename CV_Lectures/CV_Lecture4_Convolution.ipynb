    "## Lecture 4 - Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Convolutions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A fundamental and powerful operation in signal/image processing.\n",
    "* Has been hypothesised as a good model of low-level biological visual processing.\n",
    "* Convolutional Neural Networks (**CNN**s) - big part of recent wave of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Can be used for**:\n",
    "* Edge detection\n",
    "* Image denoising\n",
    "* Edge enhancement/sharpening\n",
    "* Object Localization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a convolution\n",
    "* Concurrently applying a local function to parts of the image.\n",
    "* Unlike pixelwise operations this looks at a <u> group</u> of pixels in a neighbourhood.\n",
    "* [Convolution animations](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1)\n",
    "* The way this function is applied to a single image is sometimes refered to as a <u>sliding window</u>, as the function only sees a small portion of the image at a time.\n",
    "* Convolutions are trivially parallellised (one of the reasons for their success).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take one row of an image and convolution combines this with a data structure that looks like a tiny image with one row and two columns containing two carefully chosen values:\n",
    "\n",
    "|+1|-1|\n",
    "|--|--|\n",
    "\n",
    "This mini-array is known as:\n",
    "* mask\n",
    "* weight array\n",
    "* operator\n",
    "* kernel filter\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it it is flipped to make a **template**.\n",
    "\n",
    "|-1|+1|\n",
    "|--|--|\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine the template with the image and a combination of multiplication and addition.<br> Imagine sliding the mask (consisting of the collection of computations) along the input array, filling the output array as you slide along.\n",
    "<br> Must be done for every row/line in the image and the results are assembled to form a new image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolution Template - Horizontal Differencing:\n",
    "\n",
    "|-1|+1|\n",
    "|--|--|\n",
    "\n",
    "Gives a first order approximation of the derivative of the image (in the x) using finite differences.\n",
    "* Measures strength of vertical edges.\n",
    "* Approximating the derivative at the point in-between 2 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. These templates are not restricted to being 1D. Convolution function can operate on neighbours in both x and y.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sobel Filter:**\n",
    "Provides a mechanism for reducing noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "| 1|0|1| \n",
    "|-|-|-|\n",
    "|-2|0|2|\n",
    "|-1|0|1|\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Implementation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from scipy.signal import convolve2d\n",
    "sobel_x_kernel = [[-1,-,+1],[-2, 0, +2],[-1, 0, +1]]\n",
    "sobel_x_img = convolve2d(img_gray ,sobel_x_kernel , ’same’)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\"same\" refers to the padding.\n",
    "#### Sobel Filter in y:\n",
    "To get gradients in the other direction transpose the filter:\n",
    "\n",
    "|-1|-2|-1|\n",
    "|:-:|:--:|:--:|\n",
    "|0|0|0|\n",
    "|1|2|1|\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Average Filtering:**\n",
    "Smooth out the image noise by performing a weighted average in a local area.\n",
    "|$\\frac{1}{9}$|$\\frac{1}{9}$|$\\frac{1}{9}$|\n",
    "|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n",
    "|$\\frac{1}{9}$|$\\frac{1}{9}$|$\\frac{1}{9}$|\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{9}$|$\\frac{1}{9}$|$\\frac{1}{9}$|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if we incease the size of the mask to e.g. 1 by 5:\n",
    "|-1|-2|0|+2|+1|\n",
    "|-|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "**More surrounding data is used - effect of this depends on the numbers in the mask.**\n",
    "<br> Combines smoothing and horizontal edge differencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formula:**\n",
    "* Given image $I$ and template $M$. <br> Ignore edge of image for now and suppose a template with an odd number of elements.\n",
    "* M is represented by a ($2N+1$) x ($2N-1$) matrix$^1$ - these are indexed from $-N$ to $N$ so that the centre element of $M$ is $M$($0,0$).\n",
    "* And so can write:\n",
    "* $O(x,y) = M\\star I(x,y) = \\sum\\limits^{N}_{i=-N}\\sum\\limits^{N}_{j=-N} M(i,j)I(x-i,y-i)$ <br> Where O is the output image.\n",
    "\n",
    "$^1$ Can take any mask and pad with 0s to make square with an odd width.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dealing with array boundaries:**\n",
    "Possible methods:\n",
    "* Make output array smaller than input - miss of a few rows and columns so mask never has to go over edge of the input array.\n",
    "* \"wrap around\" the input array - right edge joins the left and the top joins the bottom. **Not** usually a good idea but fits in with a computational method of doing convolutions - **Fourier transform**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume input array surrounded by 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume left-hand column of input is repeated to the left as far as necessary, and the same for other boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume data is reflected in the boundaries of the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Convolution and Correlation**:\n",
    "* Not the same thing.\n",
    "* Convolution is a filtering operation - like detecting high frequency spatial content to expose edges.\n",
    "    - Convolution flips the mask to produce a convolution template.\n",
    "    - The reason for the flip is that masks can be convolved together to make new masks.\n",
    "* Correlation looks looks at how similar two signals or patterns are: You do **NOT** flip the mask."
