What is Computer Vision:
* Use computers to understand image and video data aquired from the real world.

* Online reading:
    * [Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Interface - Simon J. D. Prince](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/s.prince/book/book.pdf "This book has more machine learning view points.Simon J. D. Prince.  Computer Vision:  Models, Learning,and Inference.  Cambridge University Press.  2012.  The onlineversion of the book is available at Simon’s homepage")

    * [Computer Vision:  Algorithms and Applications.  Springer.  2010. - Richard Szeliski.](http://szeliski.org/Book/drafts/SzeliskiBook_20100903_draft.pdf "The online version of the book is available at Richard’s homepage")

    * [Sussex Computer Vision Teach Files - David Young](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~davidy/teachvision/vision0.html "Sussex Computer Vision Teach Files by David Young are very good, if somewhat elderly:.")

* Uses of:

    * Relieve humans of boring, easy tasks

    * Human-computer interaction

    * Perception for robotics / autonomous agents
    
    * Organize and give access to visual content
